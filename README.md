# NBA Defensive Impact Project

Overview:

This R project models NBA win probabilities using defensive stats from 1,230 team-games in the 2023-24 season. It compares Logistic Regression, LDA, and Classification Trees via 80/20 splits and 10-fold CV, achieving AUC 0.79 with low variance.
​

Key Findings:

Each defensive rebound boosts win odds by 24%; steals help strongly while fouls hurt. Well-calibrated probabilities aid scouting and strategy.
