# NBA Defensive Impact Project

Overview:

This project analyzes how common defensive actions relate to winning single NBA games. Using team‑game box scores from the 2023–24 season, it models win probability from five familiar stats: defensive rebounds, steals, blocks, turnovers, and personal fouls. The work emphasizes clarity and validation, pairing simple, interpretable models with out‑of‑sample checks and coach‑friendly visuals.

Key findings:

Defensive rebounds and steals are strongly associated with higher chances of winning, blocks help modestly, and turnovers and fouls are associated with lower chances of winning. The model’s probabilities are well calibrated and rank games effectively by win likelihood, supporting practical use in scouting, lineup decisions, and practice priorities.
